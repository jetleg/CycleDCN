# CycleDCN
The codes used in CycleDCN include C and OPL. C++ code is used to generate the demand matrix of specific load and PTL, and complete the routing function (implement heuristic routing algorithm and generate routing table). CPLEX OPL code compression package is used to realize the method of linear programming to solve problems.
