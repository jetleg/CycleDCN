# CycleDCN
  The codes used in CycleDCN include C , CPLEX OPL and OMNet++. C code is used to generate the demand matrix of specific load and PTL, and complete the routing function (implement heuristic routing algorithm and generate routing table). CPLEX OPL code compression package is used to realize the method of linear programming to solve problems. OMNet++ code is used to simulate the whole network and get throughput and average end-to-end latency at different load and network size.
  With C code, you can adjust the value of load and PTL to get throughput in different situations. You can also get the matrix F' and copy it to get the solution with CPLEX code by optimization method proposed in our paper. You can view the delay parameters that we set or adjust load or port number in OMNet++ .ini file.
